# Per-job pricing configuration for the AI Trading Blueprint
#
# Pricing is handled by the Tangle protocol via EIP-712 signed operator quotes:
#   - Subscription: createServiceFromQuotes() — flat rate covers all jobs within TTL
#   - Per-job: submitJobFromQuote() — signed per-job quotes with protocol enforcement
#
# The on-chain TradingBlueprint.sol does NOT enforce payment in onJobCall.
# Instead, it exposes informational helpers for the off-chain pricing engine:
#   - getDefaultJobRates(baseRate) — returns per-job rates as (baseRate * multiplier)
#   - getJobPriceMultiplier(jobId) — returns the multiplier for a specific job
#

# Job ID  Name               Multiplier  Description
# 0       JOB_PROVISION      50x         Deploy vault + sidecar (expensive)
# 1       JOB_CONFIGURE      2x          Update strategy params
# 2       JOB_START_TRADING   1x          Start trading loop
# 3       JOB_STOP_TRADING    1x          Stop trading loop
# 4       JOB_STATUS          0x          Read-only query (free)
# 5       JOB_DEPROVISION     1x          Teardown
# 6       JOB_EXTEND          10x         Extend bot lifetime
# 30      JOB_WORKFLOW_TICK   N/A         Cron-triggered (internal)
#
# ─── How Pricing Works ──────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# 1. Operator publishes a base rate (e.g., 0.001 ETH) via the pricing engine
# 2. getDefaultJobRates(baseRate) computes per-job rates using multipliers
# 3. Operator signs EIP-712 quotes for each job at those rates
# 4. Consumer submits jobs via submitJobFromQuote() with the signed quote
# 5. Protocol collects payment, distributes to operator, slashes on violations
#
# Under SUBSCRIPTION pricing (PricingModelHint.SUBSCRIPTION):
#   - Consumer pays at service creation via createServiceFromQuotes()
#   - All jobs within the service TTL are pre-paid
#   - No per-job payment needed — submitJob() works with zero value
#
# ─── Per-Service Overrides ──────────────────────────────────────────
# This file configures the off-chain pricing engine's GetJobPrice RFQ handler.
# Each section is a service ID; keys are job indices, values are prices in wei.
# When a consumer calls GetJobPrice(service_id, job_index), the pricing engine
# looks up the price here and returns a signed EIP-712 quote.

# [1]
# 0  = "50000000000000000"    # JOB_PROVISION:    0.05 ETH  (50x base)
# 1  = "2000000000000000"     # JOB_CONFIGURE:    0.002 ETH (2x base)
# 2  = "1000000000000000"     # JOB_START_TRADING: 0.001 ETH (1x base)
# 6  = "10000000000000000"    # JOB_EXTEND:       0.01 ETH  (10x base)

# ─── Validator Blueprint Job IDs ────────────────────────────────────
# 0 = JOB_UPDATE_REPUTATION  (free, operator-internal)
# 1 = JOB_UPDATE_CONFIG      (free)
# 2 = JOB_LIVENESS           (free)
# Validator jobs are operator-submitted, not user-facing. No pricing needed.
