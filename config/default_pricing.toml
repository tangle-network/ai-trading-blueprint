# Default resource pricing for the AI Trading Blueprint
#
# Defines pricing rates for compute resources consumed by trading bot
# sidecar containers. The pricing engine uses these rates to calculate
# GetPrice RFQ quotes for service consumers.
#
# Rates are specified in USD with decimal precision.
# The pricing engine runs as a standalone sidecar — operators deploy it
# alongside the blueprint binary and configure it with this file.
